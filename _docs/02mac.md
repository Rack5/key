### DISABLING KEY
The other day I had let a friend use my laptop for about 20 minutes to book some movie tickets. During that time, I needed to make sure Key didn’t lock my computer as I walked away.

I went into Key's **Menu Bar &gt; Disable**. Just like that, Key didn’t lock or unlock while my friend was using it. When I got My laptop back, I followed the same procedure to Enable Key.

### CALIBRATING KEY
Key measures distance based on the strength of your Bluetooth connection. Sometimes, things get between your phone and laptop. Depending on the material, this may affect the connection strength and make Key misbehave.

The other day I was sitting at a metal desk with my phone in my pocket. As far as bluetooth connections go, I could have been a room away.

I calibrated Key by going into Key's **Menu Bar &gt; More &gt; Calibrate**. Key calibrated over the course of 10 seconds and behaved normally again.

We will continue working to make sure these things don't need as much tinkering and just work.

### CHECK FOR UPDATES
When updates come around, Key will ask you if you'd like to update. We recommend saying yes. In fact, you can opt in to update automatically. We sure do.
