On your phone, Key broadcasts a unique signal using Bluetooth Low Energy to show computers it’s presence.

When your phone approaches your Mac, your Mac magically unlocks. When your phone leaves, your Mac locks up.

### BOUNCER

![Bouncer]({{"/images/bouncer.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl}}){:style="width:50%"}

"What if someone else gets my phone?" - A question asked by many.

Well, we hired our buddy, Bouncer! And Bouncer needs to check your I.D.! He won’t let you in without it!

When you turn on Bouncer, Key checks your fingerprint or lock screen pin to before unlocking your Mac. This virtually guarantees that if someone else picks up your phone, they can't log in as you.

Bouncer will always let you out and lock up, but to get back in, you’re gonna need to show some ID!

### LOGOUT

If you decide you no longer want Key to work on your device, simply log out. Logging out will remove your device from your Key account and remove any sensitive data. Just hit

More &gt; Logout.
