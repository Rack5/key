App gremlins exist. We've seen them. They cause random errors, crashes, or make things look and feel funny.

It's pretty safe to say Key isn't immune to these gremlins. Thankfully, we have a few things that worked for us to get rid of them.

We recommend:

- **Close or Quit the app.** On your Mac, in the menu bar click the Key icon, and click quit at the bottom. On your iPhone, simply double-click the home button and swipe the app up. Open the app back up to see if your problem is solved.
- **Logout, then Log in.** Your data is safe with us, so you likely won't lose anything... but logging out cleans the settings and will give you a nice fresh start when you log back in.
- [**Have you tried turning it off and on again?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85xwZ_OLX0){:target="blank"} We may hate that question but even experienced IT professionals have been amazed over the magic of a quick reboot. Give it a go and see if your problem continues.
- **Email Us.** We're friendly people and hate when things don't behave as much as you do. Shoot us an email at support@rack5.co and we will be sure to help you out as soon as possible. Any info you can give us can help us help you!
