### Getting Started with Key

Passwords are impossible to remember. You have to change them all the time. You know you need to protect things but you also just need to get through your day.

We want to make managing your logins easier and more secure than you can possibly imagine.

### Locking &amp; Unlocking

Have you ever worked in a shared office and didn't quite know everyone around you? A quick trip to the bathroom leaves whatever your working on vulnerable to someone who probably shouldn't see it.

Key uses the Bluetooth signal on your phone to inform your computer when you are approaching or leaving. Your computer uses this signal to unlock and lock itself accordingly.

Wondering eyes problem solved. Pretty nifty, eh?

Locking and unlocking your laptop is just the beginning. We're working to log you into websites and more life without any extra effort from you!
