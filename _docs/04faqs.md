**How do my phone and computer see each other?**

Using Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy (LE), Key can sense the distance between your phone and your computer to give you access when you need it, and peace of mind when you don’t - all without draining your battery.

**When are you releasing the Android app?**

Android devices are very fragmented, and few of them support Bluetooth LE at this time. As a result, we'd be spending lots of time and effort making an app very few could use. Not to worry, it is on the roadmap and we have every intention on making one in the future.

**My Computer doesn't support Bluetooth LE, do I have to buy a new computer?**

Not at all! USB to Bluetooth LE dongles are rather inexpensive, and we have been using[IOGEAR's Bluetooth 4.0 USB Micro Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007GFX0PY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) since the beginning. As much as we all would like an excuse for a new computer, you can make do without!

**What if I lose my phone? Am I locked out and insecure?**

If you lose your phone, log into your computer like you normally would (with your password... gross!) and using the Key menu you can unpair your phone. We recommend anyone who loses a phone [remote wipe](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2701?locale=en_US) the device to prevent data theft.
