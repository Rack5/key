#### Key is Fast
Hold onto your iPhone! When you and your iPhone walk away from your Mac, Key locks your screen. When you come back, Key unlocks your screen. It literally couldn't be more quick and simple.

#### Key is Secure
We used some of the most battle tested security protocols to make Key secure. Secrets are encrypted, stored, and synced over iCloud Keychain (we don't hold onto any of your data), and codes sent over bluetooth are changed *every second*. It's pretty impressive.
